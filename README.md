This is a Unity project for university and work applications to show that I know basic coding.
It is kept short to keep the reviewing process simple, but possible changes and additions are outlined in TODO comments.

The project represents a re-creation or sight reading of one of my favorite mechanics of a childhood game,
the hookshot in Teeworlds.

The controls are:  
A/D - Move left/right  
Space - Jump  
Right Mouse Button - Fire the hookshot
